        <p>This paper examines the inflation rates for the period 2005–06 and 2011–12 and concludes 
            that inflation in 2005-06 hurts the poor more since the rise in food prices was substantial in 
            this period and food constitutes a substantial proportion of their total expenditure. The paper 
            observes that there was a substantial rise in Inflation which was experienced in the food 
            grains like egg, fish, and meat, while the growth of inflation rate was observed minimal in 
            case of beverages, footwear, and edible oil. Further, the impact of inflation on poor varied not 
            only across both rural and urban areas but also the impact was different for different time 
            periods. The paper also depicts shifts in the pattern of inflation rate across the expenditure 
            classes between 2005–06 and 2011–12 and establishes inverse association between inflation 
            rate and expenditure in the year 2005-06 for both rural and urban areas while the 
            relationship was completely distinct in case of 2011–12 for both rural and urban areas. The 
            study clearly reveals that bottom thirty percent of the population in rural areas observes same 
            inflation rate as their urban counterparts for the year 2005-06. Finally, the paper concludes 
            that the impact of inflation is not only commodity specific but also decile class specific. 
            Further, the impact of inflation is observed to be different for rural and urban areas. This 
            establishes the role of policy and government intervention through the public distribution 
            scheme favoring the poor section with the aim of minimizing the gap of the impact of inflation 
            experienced by poor and rich. <img src="../clip/ad.jpg" align="top-right" aria-setsize="1" ></p>
